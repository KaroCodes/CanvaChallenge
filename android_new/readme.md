PhotoMosaic - Canva interview challenge for Android Software Engineer
------------

If I were to update this solution based on my learnings after nearly 5 years at Canva, as well as follow 2022 standards, this is what I would do:
- Replace RxJava with Coroutines
- Improve DI (Dependency Injection)
- Replace MVP (Model View Presenter) with MVVM (Model View View-Model) that is used at Canva
- Seperate network/storage layer from the presenter

Lemme know in the comments under [this video](https://youtu.be/rpmPeFzEAEs) if you'd like me to make a new video implementing and explaining those changes ðŸ˜ƒ
